<span class="level">Prehistory and Evolutionary Origins</span>
<br>Early humans and chimpanzees diverged genetically [4-7 mya]. Prehistory and the Old Stone Age (Palaeolithic) began with stone tool use by early humans [3.3 mya]. Anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) arose in Africa [300 kya]. The New Stone Age (Neolithic) began with the Agricultural Revolution [12 kya]; it was a wide transition of humans from hunter-gatherer nomads to farming settlers.
<br>
<br>

<span class="level">Ancient History and Cradles of Civilization</span>
<br>Cradles of civilization arose near river banks for potable water. In the Middle East, the Sumerians of Mesopotamia [4000-2000 BCE] and Ancient Egyptians [3150-332 BCE] were among the first. South Asia saw the Indus Valley Civilization [3300-1300 BCE] and later the Assyrian Empire [2500-610 BCE]. Ancient China arose from a complex joint influence of the Yangtze, Liao, and Yellow River cultures [2200 BCE].
<br>
<br>Near and Far East relations are unclear, though the South American Andean Civilizations [3500 BCE] arose independently with the notable Mesoamerican Mayan Civilization arising later [1800 BCE].
<br>
<br>Soon after civilizations arose, writing developed to facilitate their administration. Ancient history begins with the first known writing in Sumer [3300 BCE], though it developed independently in all cradles. Similarly, the Bronze Age began with the transition to bronze use and varies geographically with the earliest being in the Near East [3300 BCE].
<br>
<br>Judaism, as an organised religion, arose in the Bronze Age, while Hinduism's diverse roots formed in the Vedic period [1500-500 BCE].

<br>
<br>

<span class="level">Antiquity and the Origins of Religions</span>
<br>The Iron Age began with the transition to iron use and, like the Bronze Age, varies geographically with the earliest being in the Near East [1200 BCE]. Most of the world became incorporated into the Eurasian iron age civilizations of Classical Antiquity [800 BCE - 600 CE].
<br>
<br>In Europe, Ancient Greece emerged [1100-800 BCE] as a set of city states and the cradle of the West. Ancient Rome grew from a kingdom [753-509 BCE] to a republic [509-27 BCE] that conquered Greece [146 BCE] to a vast empire [27 BCE]. Later it split into Western and Eastern empires [286 CE]
with the former falling to the Visigoths [476 CE] and the latter (the Byzantine Empire) falling to the Ottomans [1453 CE].
<br>
<br>In Western Asia, the Achaemenid (or First Persian) Empire had the largest territory of any empire yet during its reign [550-330 BCE]. South Asia's Ancient India saw the Maurya Empire [322-185 BCE] and later the Gupta Empire [240-550 CE] (often called India's golden age). East Asia's Ancient China became imperial under the oppressive Qin dynasty [221-206 BCE], but was supplanted by the Han dynasty [202 BCE - 220 CE] (often called China's golden age).
<br>
<br>Antiquity also saw the foundations of the world's major religions. The Buddha [c.480-400 BCE] gave teachings central to Buddhism, while Hinduism's diverse roots saw a synthesis [500 BCE - 300 CE]. Confucius [551-479 BCE] and Laozi [a possible contemporary] formed philosophies (sometimes seen as religions) central to Confucianism and Taoism (both important in China). Christianity, founded on the teachings of Jesus [c.4 BCE - 30/33 CE], developed out of Judaism. While Islam, founded on the teachings of Muhammad [c.570-632 CE], developed later and has a complex relationship with Christianity (though all three are Abrahamic religions).
<br>
<br>The Silk Road [130 BCE-1453 CE] was a network of trade routes connecting the East and West economically, politically, and even religiously. Finally, Mesoamerican, Japanese, African, and other civilizations also made comparable advances during antiquity, but had less reach.

<span class="level">Post-classical History and the Rise of Religions</span>
<br>Post-classical history ('The Middle Ages' in European history) [Early:500-1000, High:1000-1200, Late:-1200-1500] saw Europe fall behind globally. It began around the fall of the Western Roman Empire, which was succeeded by the Frankish Empire [481-843], which later split into East Francia [843-962] and the Holy Roman Empire [800-1806] (the former a precursor to France and the latter to Germany and Italy).
<br>
<br>Christianity expanded through missionaries and split into Catholic and Orthodox churches in the East-West Schism [1054] with the former supporting a series of religious wars called the Crusades [11c.-17c.].
<br>
<br>In the Middle East and North Africa, Islamic empires called Caliphates expanded; the Abbasid Caliphate [750-1258] afforded the Islamic Golden Age [8c.-1258] with immense flourishing, and later came the Ottoman Empire [1299-1923] who conquered the Byzantine Empire [1453].
<br>
<br>In India, Islam spread to form the Delhi Sultanate [1206-1526]; noted as one of the few powers to repel the Mongol Empire [1206-1294], which was founded by Genghis Khan [1162-1227] and nonetheless the largest contiguous land empire ever.
<br>
<br>China saw technological advancements with the Tang dynasty [690-907 CE] and Song dynasty [960-1279 CE], but remained largely isolated.
<br>
<br>In spite of stagnation and the Black Death [1347-1351] killing up to half of the population, European powers renewed ancient knowledge during the Renaissance [13c.-17c.] and explored overseas extensively during the Age of Discovery [15c.-17c.].
<br>
<br>Post-classical history ends with the European colonisation of the Americas [1492], which brought the end for the Mesoamerican Aztecs [1345-1533] and South American Inca Empire [1438-1533], but the way for European global domination.

<br>
<br>


<span class="level">Modern History</span>
<br>Early Modern History [c.1500-1815] saw Gutenberg [c.1400-1468] introduce movable type printing to Europe. This enabled the continuation of the Renaissance and would later be crucial to the Scientific Revolution [1543-1687]. It also contributed to Protestants splitting off from the Catholics during the Reformation [1517-1648].
<br>
<br>As Christianity expanded, so did Islam through the Mughal (or Mogul) Empire of India [1526-1857], the Safavid Empire of Iraq [1501-1722], and the ongoing Ottoman Empire [1299-1923] of the Middle East and Europe. These three, the strongest and stablest economies of early modern history, were the gunpowder empires.
<br>
<br>The Scientific Revolution saw the emergence of modern science in Europe culminating in Newton [1642-1727] publishing theories which were foundational to all of engineering [1687]. It was followed by the Age of Enlightenment [17c.-19c.] which grew out of the Renaissance. While the gunpowder empires and China's Ming dynasty [1368-1644] would resist European expansion, they were overwhelmed by stronger technology and organisation.
<br>
<br>The American Revolution [1765–1783] and the French Revolution [1789-1799] transformed Western political expectations; the USA emerged a democracy, though France was destabilised for a century. Nationalist uprisings enabled Latin American independence [1808-1826], but in the Old World to the East colonialism continued, and the First Industrial Revolution [mid-18c.-1830] (confined to Britain) and the Second Industrial Revolution [mid-19c.-early-20c.] (confined to continental Europe, the US, and Japan) supported and incentivised this New Imperialism. While Abolitionism [19c.] ended institutional slavery in the West, European imperialism continued to rise, as seen in the Scramble for Africa [1881-1914]. The British Empire was the largest by area.
<br>
<br>In recent history, WWI [1914-18] shook European empires and helped spark the Russian Revolution [1917-23] giving rise to the Soviet Union [1917-91]. After the Great Depression [1929-33] and WWII [1939-45], Europe had to decolonize and unify internally. Meanwhile, the Cold War [1947-91] dominated geopolitics with its Space Race [1955-69] ending with the Moon Landing.

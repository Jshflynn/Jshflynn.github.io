    <div class="philosopher">Bernard Williams</div>
    <div class="dates">(1929 - 2003)</div>
    <div class="ideas">The possibility of knowledge of any kind depends upon the possibility of an 'absolute conception' of the world.</div>
    <div class="ideas">An objective 'absolute conception' of the world can be attained through natural science.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Knowledge is possible only if its possibility can be scientifically comprehended.</div>
    <div class="ideas">There can be no external reasons for action, once they enter into our explanations of our actions, they become internal.</div>
    <div class="ideas">A utilitarian assessment of duty is a form of alienation because the agent's own welfare counts simply as someone's welfare.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Harry Frankfurt</div>
    <div class="dates">(1929 - )</div>
    <div class="ideas">Free action does not require that an agent "could have done otherwise."</div>
    <div class="ideas">An agent is free when her 'first-order' intentions causing action are in harmony with her reflective 'second-order' intentions.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Jacques Derrida</div>
    <div class="dates">(1930 - 2004)</div>
    <div class="ideas">Writing is different from speech; the reader is absent when we write, and the author and his/her intentions are absent when we read.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The legibility of the text is indifferent to the communicational parameters (context, speaker; receiver, message) it first had.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The intended meaning of a text is incapable of being stabilized; rereading may activate new meanings ('iteration').</div>
    <div class="ideas">Every text is riddled with gaps, holes, and contradictions ('aporias').</div>
    <div class="ideas">Meaning is always deferred in language; it depends on what else we say, which depends on what else we say, and so on.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The meaning of the words we use depends on their relationship to (difference from) the words we are not using.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Meaning is not self-contained within the text, not even present to the author, because it is a matter of deferring and differing ('differance').</div>
    <div class="ideas">Explanation of a text has to grow indefinitely; there is nothing outside of the text.</div>
    <div class="ideas">We should expose the Platonistic dual hierarchies (good/evil, mind/body, etc.) in texts and mark them with new terms ('deconstruction').</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Richard Rorty</div>
    <div class="dates">(1931 - 2007)</div>
    <div class="ideas">There is no absolute distinction between the contributions of language and the world to the truth of what we say.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Knowledge is a matter of conversation and of social practice, rather than as an attempt to mirror nature.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Philosophy is not any longer a constructive discipline; it is an edifying one concerned to expose illusion and to keep the conversation going.</div>
    <div class="ideas">We should look forward to a post-Philosophical culture in which philosophy amounts to a study of the advantages of the various ways of talking.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Truth is what your contemporaries let you get away with.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">John Searle</div>
    <div class="dates">(1932 - )</div>
    <div class="ideas">Five types of speech acts: assertives (e.g. statements), directives (e.g. orders), commissives (e.g. promises), expressives (e.g. thanks), and declarations (e.g. hirings).</div>
    <div class="ideas">There are indirect speech acts where the speaker performs one kind of speech act by means of performing another. ("You are standing on my foot.")</div>
    <div class="ideas">Mental states are intrinsic and irreducible features of certain very complex kinds of biological system.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Unless a mental state has the potential to be conscious, it does not qualify as genuinely mental.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Real understanding cannot be a matter of mere symbol manipulation; computers cannot be conscious.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Because mental states are biological, they can cause and be caused by physical changes in human bodies.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Language and other artifacts have intentionality derived from the 'original/intrinsic intentionality' of our conscious mental states.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Signification is illocutionary; linguistic conventions are sufficient to endow intentional meaning, independent of the presence of the sender.</div>
    <div class="ideas">We-intentions (collective intentions) are held by individuals but they are not reducible to I-intentions.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Objective social reality (games, money, language, etc.) is created by means of we-intentions.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Human beings have the capacity to be motivated by desire-independent reasons for action (such as promises).</div>
    <div class="ideas">It is possible to derive 'ought' from 'is' if we start from facts which concern human institutions (such as promises).</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Jerry Fodor</div>
    <div class="dates">(1935 - 2017)</div>
    <div class="ideas">Every event that falls under a special science predicate also falls under a physical predicate, but not vice versa.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The special sciences are 'autonomous' with their irreducible generalizations about irreducible and casually efficacious higher-level properties.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Brain states are like computer states, capable of representation in virtue of causal connections with the world.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Thought draws upon brain states which function as sentence-like representations.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The mind contains a number of highly specialized, modular systems, whose operations are largely independent from each other.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The brain's central systems of belief fixation, planning, etc. are not modular; they are domain-general, unencapsulated.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The complexity of our minds is irrelevant to the question of whether they're the products of natural selection.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The theory of natural selection cannot predict/explain what traits are selected-for and what traits are free-riders.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Thomas Nagel</div>
    <div class="dates">(1937 - )</div>
    <div class="ideas">We cannot altogether abandon our subjectivity and fully objectify our knowledge (from a 'view from nowhere').</div>
    <div class="ideas">Objective knowledge about an organism's behaviour and physiology does not allow us to form a conception of its subjective experience.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Ethics is a branch of psychology.</div>
    <div class="ideas">There are prudential, rational, timeless, internal reasons for action, independent of our current concerns.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Reasons for action are impersonal; if I act in some way on my own behalf, I should act the same way on behalf of others similarly situated.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Sandra Harding</div>
    <div class="dates">(1935 - )</div>
    <div class="ideas">A detached (gender-free) position fails to do justice to facts that women are epistemically privileged with (such as sexual harassment).</div>
    <div class="ideas">A truly objective evaluation has to start by taking seriously the subjective standpoint of those who employ the judgements in question.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Carol Gilligan</div>
    <div class="dates">(1936 - )</div>
    <div class="ideas">For women, responsibilities arising from personal relationships are more important than abstract claims of justice.</div>
    <div class="ideas">We should accept an 'ethics of care' which structure private life in addition to the more 'masculine' ethics of rights and duties.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Robert Nozick</div>
    <div class="dates">(1938 - 2002)</div>
    <div class="ideas">The strongest reason to advocate a libertarian society is that such advocacy follows from a respect for individual rights.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Individuals are self-owners; they have rights to their lives, liberty, and the fruits of their labour.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The various programs of the modern liberal welfare state (e.g. taxation) are immoral because they make slaves of the citizens of such a state.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The only sort of state that can be morally justified is a 'minimal state' which protects individuals from force via police and law, but does nothing else.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Knowledge is true belief that tracks the truth by varying according to the state of things in close possible worlds.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Saul Kripke</div>
    <div class="dates">(1940 - )</div>
    <div class="ideas">There are rigid designators, names/descriptions that refer to the same thing in all possible worlds, which allow essentialist theses.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Ordinary proper names are rigid designators of ordinary things.</div>
    <div class="ideas">There are empirical necessary truths.</div>
    <div class="ideas">There are contingent a priori truths.</div>
    <div class="ideas">There are three types of essential necessity: origin, substance, and form.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The essences of natural kinds can be illuminatingly identified in scientific terms.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Frank Jackson</div>
    <div class="dates">(1943 - )</div>
    <div class="ideas">Even if you have all the objective knowledge about colour vision, seeing colours ('qualia') gives you new information.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">David Lewis</div>
    <div class="dates">(1941 - 2001)</div>
    <div class="ideas">Worlds that are merely possible are just as real as the actual world we happen to live in; these worlds are separate space-times.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Essentialist claims draw upon similarities between different, but similar, things (counterparts) in different worlds.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Our beliefs about what is possible/impossible concern the details of worlds that are altogether separate from our world.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Insofar as our mental states are causes of our physical actions, they too are physical, because physics is a 'closed' science.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Supervenience guarantees the reduction of the mental to the physical.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Mental-physical state identities should be restricted to species or even particular organisms.</div>
    <div class="ideas">When you have all the objective knowledge about colour vision, seeing a new colour is not new factual knowledge.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">John McDowell</div>
    <div class="dates">(1942 - )</div>
    <div class="ideas">There are cases where the requirement imposed by the situation and detected by the agent must exhaust his reason for acting as he does.</div>
    <div class="ideas">'Properly brought up' people are motivated to do what is required simply by recognizing an obligation, without deliberation.</div>
    <div class="ideas">In moral conversions, a new awareness of external reasons for action creates a shift in motivation.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The fact that the identity of moral values is dependent (like colours) upon a human point of view does not undermine their reality.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Richard Boyd</div>
    <div class="dates">(1942 - )</div>
    <div class="ideas">Moral values are best conceived as natural properties to be identified by inquires in anthropology and sociology.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Moral values are explanatory properties. (e.g. Hitler's wickedness is part of the explanation of the Holocaust.)</div>
    <div class="ideas">The explanatory role of moral values is to guide the identification of the natural properties which underpin this role.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The utilitarian principle provides the basis for a naturalistic treatment of moral values.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Simon Blackburn</div>
    <div class="dates">(1944 - )</div>
    <div class="ideas">In our moral judgements we express our feelings (which are a species of desire), not describe them.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Our talk of ethics is quasi-realist; our feelings colour our experience of the world by projecting values onto it.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Tim Scanlon</div>
    <div class="dates">(1940 - )</div>
    <div class="ideas">We should be able to justify our moral judgements with principles that others, similarly motivated, could not reject.</div>
    <div class="ideas">It is reasons for action that are fundamental in the construction of justice.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Reasons for action are not dependent upon desires; finding such reasons motivates desires.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Reasons for action are sensitive to contextual considerations; they can sometimes be undermined.</div>
    <div class="ideas">We start from our ordinary common-sense moral judgements and then refine them with our understanding of the world.</div>
    <div class="ideas">There is a core of fundamental human rights, and there are judgements which exhibit a degree of cultural relativity.</div>
    <div class="ideas">The objectivity of reasons for belief and action does not require uniformity of thought and practice; there can be different priorities.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Richard Dawkins</div>
    <div class="dates">(1941 - )</div>
    <div class="ideas">We are survival machines - robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the 'selfish' molecules ('replicators') known as genes.</div>
    <div class="ideas">An animal's behaviour tends to maximize the survival of the genes "for" that behaviour; whether or not those genes are in its body. ('extended phenotype')</div>
    <div class="ideas">Human culture evolves thanks to 'memes': information units replicating, mutating and being selected.</div>
    <div class="ideas">A cultural trait may have evolved in the way that it has, simply because it is advantageous to itself.</div>
    <div class="ideas">We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="philosopher">Daniel Dennett</div>
    <div class="dates">(1942 - )</div>
    <div class="ideas">The idea of evolution by natural selection unifies the realm of meaning and purpose with the realm of mechanism and physical law.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Reasons gradually emerged out of mere causes, 'what for's out of 'how come's, with no 'essential' dividing line between them.</div>
    <div class="ideas">There were reasons tracked by evolution ('free-floating rationales') long before there were reason-representers like us.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Comprehension is not the source of competence; it is composed of competences, and it comes in degrees.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Our intentionality is gradually derived from the intentionality of our 'selfish genes', which is derived from the functional context of evolution.</div>
    <div class="ideas">With 'the intentional stance' we can treat something as an agent without committing to hypotheses about its internal structures.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Meanings and thoughts do not show up within physics, but are apparent within 'the intentional stance' towards complex agents.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Minds are composed of simpler subsystems that are composed of teams of still simpler agents so stupid that they can be replaced by a machine.</div>
    <div class="ideas">There is not a finish line or a center (a 'Cartesian theater') in the brain where the content is 'presented' to the conscious subject.</div>
    <div class="ideas">A self is like a center of (narrative) gravity: an abstract object, a theorist's useful fiction - not a thing in the brain.</div>
    <div class="ideas">All mental activity is accomplished in the brain by parallel, competitive, multitrack processes of interpretation, under continuous editorial revision.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Consciousness is a system of user-illusions evolved to make versions of our cognitive processes accessible to us for purposes of communication.</div>
    <div class="ideas">We can study consciousness objectively by getting the subjects' verbal accounts of their conscious experiences ('heterophenomenology').</div>
    <div class="ideas">Free will (like colours, dollars, promises) is part of the user-illusion of the manifest image that we shouldn't want to dismantle; it's where we live.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Qualia are in fact the intentional objects of mistaken beliefs that simply don't exist, anywhere.</div>
    <div class="ideas">There might be variations of consciousness from poet to possum to protozoon, and no 'essence' of consciousness to discover.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Memes turned our brains into minds capable of dealing with ideas, thanks to the apps installed in our 'necktops'.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Brains are computer, but they are very unlike the computers in use today.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Unlike our computers and flip-flops, organisms and neurons are competitive agents; this may be their key difference.</div>
    <div class="ideas">Brains are more like termite colonies than intelligently designed corporations or armies.</div>
